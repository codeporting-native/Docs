## Evaluate CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp ##

You can easily download CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp for evaluation. The evaluation download is the same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you apply license to CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp.

The evaluation version of CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it throws evaluation error message and stops the porting process when source C# project does not comply to evaluation limitations.

{{<note>}}
If you want to test CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. Please refer to <a href="https://purchase.csporter.com/temporary-license">How to get a Temporary License?</a>

## Major Features ##

1. Porter now generates STL-style iteration methods (begin, end, cbegin, and so on) for ported classes which implement generic IEnumerable interface. To control this behavior, use generate_begin_end_methods porter option.
1. The number of includes generated by porter is decreased. Forward declarations are now used where possible.
1. Is.LessThan, Is.GreaterThan and Is.Positive NUnit assertions are now supported by porter.
1. 'ref' and 'out' parameters are now properly ported for delegates and events.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Increments and decrements on indexers are now compiling after porting.
1. Non-generic IEnumerator is now properly working with IterateOver syntax.
1. In ported code, friend declarations can now be excluded from Doxygen analysis. The new hide_friend_declarations option controls this behavior.
1. A new 'CppMakeMembersPublic' attribute was added allowing it to make all type's entities public.
